    <h3>HOME PAGE</h3>
    <p>On the homepage, I kept the heading nice and big to grab the user's attention right away. As they scroll down, three image buttons—
       'My Designs', 'Theory', and 'Visualisations'—appear smoothly, which makes the experience feel fluid and gives users a clear choice of 
       where to go next. I wanted these buttons to act as natural entry points to the main sections of the site.
    </p><br>
    <p>To make the buttons more interactive, I added a hover effect where they enlarge when the mouse moves over them, then shrink back once 
       the mouse is removed. It’s a simple but effective way to show users that these buttons are clickable. At the bottom of the page, I’ve 
       placed the footer so that important info like contact details and navigation options are always accessible.

    <h3>DESIGN PAGE</h3>
    <p>For the design page, I went with a large heading to keep things consistent and attention-grabbing right from the start. The 
       navigation bar sits at the top of the screen, nice and clear, so users can easily move between different sections. This page is where 
       I lay out all my design choices—everything from wireframes to the style guide, color scheme, UI/UX decisions, and website inspirations.
    </p><br>
    <p>To keep the layout clean and easy to follow, I placed all the images on the left-hand side, with accompanying paragraphs on the right 
       that explain each design choice in more detail. The fonts I’ve used are simple and readable, making sure the text is easy on the eyes 
       while still being informative.

    <h3>THEORY PAGE</h3>
    <p>The theory page keeps the same style with a big, bold heading at the top, making it easy to identify what the page is about. The 
       navigation bar is clear and simple, right at the top for easy access to other sections of the site. This page will have my Assignment 
       2 essay available for download, along with any other essays or articles I’ve written about Interactive Media. I also plan to include 
       some extra resources like articles, podcasts, videos, and relevant links—basically anything I think is helpful or interesting for anyone 
       exploring this topic.

    <h3>VISUALISATION PAGE</h3>
    <p>The visualisation page keeps a consistent design with a large, clear heading at the top, making the purpose of the page obvious 
       right away. The navigation bar is straightforward and placed at the top, so users can easily switch between sections. On this page, 
       users will be able to choose between two visualisations through button images. However, only one visualisation will appear in the 
       center of the page at a time. My plan is to allow users to either swipe or click an arrow icon to switch between the images. Each 
       image will serve as a heading or a 'preview' of what the visualisation is about, making it more intuitive and interactive.

    <h3>VISUALISATION 1</h3>
    <p>The visualisation 1 page starts with a large, bold heading to grab attention, and the navigation bar is kept clear and simple at 
       the top for easy access. This page showcases my first data visualisation, focusing on the top golf players of 2024. Initially, 
       users will see the top 10 players displayed, but there's also a drop-down list that allows them to view the top 20 or top 30 players.

    <p>When users change the selection, the bars adjust smoothly, shrinking and shifting to reveal the updated rankings. I've also added a 
       tooltip feature, so when users hover over each bar, they’ll get more detailed information about that player, enhancing the interactive 
       experience.

    <h3>VISUALISATION 2</h3>
    <p>The Visualisation 2 page follows the same clean design as the previous pages, with a large, bold heading and a clear navigation bar 
       at the top for easy access. This page features my second data visualisation, which displays the 2024 tournaments, their purse sizes, 
       and the player winnings. Instead of a bar graph, I’ve used bubbles of different sizes and colours to represent the tournament winnings, 
       making the data visually engaging. The larger the bubble, the higher the winnings, while the colours help distinguish different 
       tournaments. To enhance interactivity, when the user hovers over any of the bubbles, a tooltip appears with more detailed information, 
       providing an intuitive way for users to explore the data.

    <h3>ABOUT ME PAGE</h3>
    <p>The About Me page features a bold heading and a clean navigation bar at the top, making it easy for users to access. On this page, 
       I’ve included a personal image of myself along with some key information about me, such as my goals in this degree, my strengths and 
       weaknesses, and how I’ve found the process of creating this website. By sharing this information, I aim to give users a better sense of 
       who I am and what drives my work. The layout is designed to be simple and clear, with easy-to-read fonts to make sure the text is engaging 
       and accessible. This page helps humanise the website and adds a personal touch, enhancing the overall user experience.

  <div class="text-container">
    <h3>HOME PAGE</h3>
    <p>For the homepage of my website, the user is greeted with a clean, welcoming layout featuring the main heading, "Amy's Golf Website." This primary heading, along with fun, dynamic icons next to it, invites interaction—users can hover over these icons, which perform a playful swinging animation to add a bit of charm. Below the heading is an introductory paragraph that provides a brief overview of the site and what users can expect, creating a warm, informative first impression.
    </p><br>
    <p>As users scroll down, three engaging button images smoothly fade in, offering navigational choices: "Designs," "Theory," and "Visualizations." These buttons are visually distinctive, making it easy for users to explore different sections. Hovering over each button subtly enlarges it, enhancing the user experience with a visual cue that the buttons are clickable. This effect adds an intuitive touch that encourages exploration and interaction across the site’s key areas.

  <div class="text-container">
    <h3>DESIGN PAGE</h3>
    <p>The Designs page of my website provides a structured and visually engaging layout for users to explore various design elements, such as my wireframes, screenshots of inspiring websites, contrast checkers, color palette, and font choices. Each image is accompanied by a neatly organized text box on the right, where users can easily read detailed descriptions relevant to the displayed visuals. This design choice ensures that users can seamlessly view both images and their explanations without clutter, enhancing readability and overall user experience.
    </p>
    <p>A drop-down menu under the Designs option in the navigation bar provides additional ease of navigation. This menu is only accessible when users are on the Designs page, creating a contextual navigation experience that helps users quickly find sections relevant to their interests. Additionally, a sticky navigation bar remains accessible at all times, allowing users to browse freely throughout the page without losing their place or needing to scroll back to the top, promoting smooth and efficient exploration.

  <div class="text-container">
    <h3>THEORY PAGE</h3>
    <p>The Theory page is designed to offer users flexible access to my essays and reflections. For users who prefer to download the content, there’s a convenient download option that provides the full Word document, allowing them to read or reference it offline at their leisure. This feature supports users who may need a formal copy for research, citation, or personal archiving.
    </p>
    <p>For users who want a quick, accessible read without downloading, the "Read Me" toggle button enables in-page reading directly on the website. This streamlined option is ideal for those who want to quickly review the content or read on-the-go without waiting for a download. The toggle feature makes it easy to switch between a brief overview and a deeper, in-depth reading experience, ensuring the page is versatile and user-friendly for all preferences.

  <div class="text-container">
    <h3>SURVEY PAGE</h3>
    <p>The survey page is designed to provide users with a straightforward and user-friendly experience. The form layout is centered on the page, keeping it simple and easy to navigate. Users are asked basic questions, including their name, email, and favorite golf club, selected from a dropdown menu. The page also includes a rating slider for users to score their experience on the website, as well as a time selector for their preferred tee-off time. For additional feedback, a message box allows users to leave any further comments. The clean layout and minimal design help keep the survey accessible and focused on user feedback.
    </p>
    <p>To ensure accuracy and usability, the survey page includes JavaScript validation. This script checks each field to confirm it meets the required format, such as verifying that the email includes an "@" symbol or that the phone number contains only digits. When all fields are correctly filled out, users receive a confirmation message, and the form is reset to ensure a smooth experience for any future submissions. This careful attention to form validation helps maintain data quality and enhances the overall user experience.

    <h3>VISUALISATION PAGE</h3>
    <p>The visualization page in this design gives users an interactive experience, allowing them to explore different visualizations seamlessly. Users can select a specific visualization by clicking on button images that represent each option. For ease of navigation, an arrow icon cycles through the available visualizations, changing both the displayed button image and relevant content automatically. This approach keeps the interface clean while ensuring that users can move intuitively between visualizations.
    </p>
    <p>Each selected visualization comes with a unique heading and description that adapts based on the current selection, ensuring that users have context and insights on what they are viewing. This dynamic setup promotes a smooth, guided exploration of information, enhancing both user engagement and comprehension as they browse through various data representations.

    <h3>VISUALISATION 1 PAGE</h3>
    <p>In this data visualization, users interact with a sleek, responsive bar graph showcasing the top golf players of 2024 and their rankings. The primary display consists of simple bars representing each player’s ranking, ensuring a clean and accessible layout. As users hover over each bar, a tooltip appears to reveal more details—such as the player’s name, ranking position, and points—providing quick, relevant insights without overwhelming the visual.
    </p>
    <p>A dropdown menu adds flexibility, allowing users to filter the data by top 10, 20, or 30 players. Selecting an option smoothly transitions the graph to display the selected range, adjusting both the bars and tooltip content seamlessly. This dynamic filtering gives users control over the level of detail they see, catering to both casual viewers interested in top players and more dedicated fans looking to explore rankings in depth.

    <h3>VISUALISATION 2 PAGE</h3>
    <p>For the second data visualization, I’ve designed an engaging bubble chart that smoothly slides in from the left side of the screen and settles at the center, immediately drawing users’ attention. This chart visually represents the purse values of various 2024 tournaments, with each bubble’s size correlating directly to the tournament’s purse amount. This scaling approach allows users to quickly grasp the relative significance of each tournament’s prize, enhancing comparative analysis at a glance.
    </p>
    <p>To further improve user interactivity, I incorporated a tooltip feature that activates on hover. When users hover over a bubble, it subtly enlarges, providing a visual cue of selection. Simultaneously, a tooltip appears, displaying the tournament's name and purse value. This design choice not only aids in precise data reading but also adds an intuitive, responsive layer to the chart, making the data exploration both informative and visually dynamic.

    <h3>VISUALISATION 3 PAGE</h3>
    <p>The third visualization is a dynamic radial chart designed to showcase the winner’s share for each golf tournament in 2024. In this chart, each tournament’s prize is represented by a dot, with larger prize amounts placed further from the center, making them more visually prominent. The dot size is also scaled to reflect the prize amount, allowing users to instantly gauge which tournaments offer the biggest rewards. Smaller prizes are positioned closer to the center, creating a layered and easy-to-read visual hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>To enhance user interactivity, the radial chart includes a slider function that smoothly transitions the dots outward, allowing users to compare the winner’s shares side by side. Additionally, three checkboxes enable users to filter dots by the number of FedEx Cup points awarded in each tournament, making it easy to focus on events of specific competitive importance. As users toggle these options, the dots move around the chart, creating a visually engaging experience that invites further exploration and comparison. This interactive design adds depth to the data, making it both informative and enjoyable to use.

    <h3>COLOUR PALETTE</h3>
    <p>I put a lot of thought into the color palette, opting for a blend of neutral tones with strategic pops of color. The neutral shades 
       create a calming, inviting atmosphere, which was important for the overall aesthetic, while the brighter accents help guide users’ 
       attention to key interactive elements like buttons and links. I wanted the palette to be visually appealing but also functional, ensuring 
       that users are naturally drawn to important parts of the site without feeling overwhelmed by too many loud colors.

       the headings to stand out, so I selected a bold, stylish typeface that grabs attention, while keeping the body text more straightforward 
       and legible for longer reading sessions. It was important to me that the fonts complement each other, creating a sense of professionalism 
       and unity across the site. I also made sure the fonts would display well on all devices, maintaining consistency regardless of screen size.

    <h3>ST. ANDREWS LINKS</h3>
    <p class="website-link"><a href="https://www.standrews.com/homepage">St. Andrews Links Website</a>
    </p>
    <p>The St Andrews Links website is a comprehensive guide to everything related to the historic golf courses in St Andrews, Scotland. It 
       features detailed information about each course, booking options, and available services, such as equipment hire and caddy services. 
       The site also highlights the history and significance of St Andrews as the "Home of Golf." What stood out to me was how the website 
       beautifully balances functionality and user experience, with clear navigation and sections dedicated to golf events, sustainability 
       efforts, and even a shop for official merchandise. The layout makes it easy to find exactly what you need, whether it’s information on 
       a specific course or help with planning your visit.

       structured content. I wanted my website to reflect a similar ease of access, where visitors can quickly find the information they’re 
       looking for without being overwhelmed. The way St Andrews Links incorporates multimedia elements—like images and videos—while maintaining 
       a professional yet welcoming tone, also influenced how I designed visual elements for my site. The overall user experience was a benchmark 
       for creating a smooth, engaging journey for my own website's visitors.

    <p>The Ralph Lauren website is a perfect example of elegance and high-end fashion combined with a user-friendly shopping experience. 
      The sleek design, clean layouts, and use of luxurious imagery instantly communicate the brand's identity. I noticed how they use neutral 
      colors like white, beige, and black to maintain a sophisticated look, while the large, high-quality photos of their products emphasize 
      detail and craftsmanship. The navigation is intuitive, making it easy to browse between categories like men's, women's, and children's 
      apparel, as well as their home decor section. Their storytelling element, "RL Stories," adds another layer by offering visitors a more 
      immersive experience into the lifestyle associated with the brand.

       organized feel. I also took note of how they highlight products with high-resolution visuals and made sure to focus on quality 
       images that are central to my site. Additionally, I liked how they subtly integrated storytelling to build a stronger connection 
       with visitors, and I drew from this idea to enhance the narrative element of my site. The balance of luxury and functionality they 
       achieve served as a great model for my design choices.

    <h3>DESIGN CHOICES</h3>
    <p>When it came to the overall design, I prioritized simplicity and a user-centered approach. I aimed for a layout that was clean and 
       organized, allowing content to be easily digestible without overwhelming users. I utilized whitespace and consistent alignment to make 
       the pages feel balanced, while the strategic use of color and typography helped guide users through the site. Every design decision was 
       made with the user in mind, ensuring that the website was visually appealing, but most importantly, functional and easy to use.
    </p><br>
    <p>For the navbar, my goal was to make navigation as seamless and intuitive as possible. I kept the design clean and simple, avoiding 
       any unnecessary clutter. I also prioritized responsiveness, so the navbar adjusts nicely on different devices, from desktops to mobile 
       phones. I felt that a well-organized, minimalistic navbar would help users stay focused on the content rather than get distracted by the 
       navigation itself.
    </p><br>
    <p>Images play an essential role on the website, so I chose them carefully to support and complement the content. I made sure each image 
       has a purpose, avoiding the temptation to overload the site with visuals. Optimizing the images for quick load times without sacrificing 
       quality was also a priority, as I didn’t want users to experience slow performance. I paid particular attention to providing alt-text for 
       each image, ensuring the site is accessible for everyone, including those using screen readers. It was crucial for me to strike a balance 
       between aesthetics and functionality with the images.

    <h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
    <p>Accessibility is something I focused on from the beginning. I wanted the site to be usable for everyone, so I incorporated features 
       like alt-text for images, sufficient color contrast, and a layout that is both clean and easy to navigate. I made sure the fonts were 
       scalable and responsive so users could adjust the text size to suit their needs. I also tested the site to ensure it could be navigated 
       entirely via keyboard, catering to users with mobility impairments. My aim was to create an inclusive design that doesn’t compromise on 
       appearance or usability.

    <h3>CONTRAST CHECKER</h3>
    <p>One of the tools I relied on during the design process was a contrast checker. It was important to me that the site met web accessibility 
       standards, so I used the checker to ensure there was enough contrast between text and background colors. This way, users with visual 
       impairments or those browsing in different lighting conditions would have no trouble reading the content. I feel this step added another 
       layer of inclusivity to the design, ensuring that the website is as user-friendly as possible.
