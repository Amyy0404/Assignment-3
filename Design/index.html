    <h3>HOME PAGE</h3>
    <p>On the homepage, I kept the heading nice and big to grab the user's attention right away. As they scroll down, three image buttons—
       'My Designs', 'Theory', and 'Visualisations'—appear smoothly, which makes the experience feel fluid and gives users a clear choice of 
       where to go next. I wanted these buttons to act as natural entry points to the main sections of the site.
    </p>
    <p>To make the buttons more interactive, I added a hover effect where they enlarge when the mouse moves over them, then shrink back once 
       the mouse is removed. It’s a simple but effective way to show users that these buttons are clickable. At the bottom of the page, I’ve 
       placed the footer so that important info like contact details and navigation options are always accessible.

    <h3>DESIGN PAGE</h3>
    <p>For the design page, I went with a large, bold heading to keep things consistent and attention-grabbing right from the start. The 
       navigation bar sits at the top of the screen, nice and clear, so users can easily move between different sections. This page is where 
       I lay out all my design choices—everything from wireframes to the style guide, color scheme, UI/UX decisions, and website inspirations.
    </p>
    <p>To keep the layout clean and easy to follow, I placed all the images on the left-hand side, with accompanying paragraphs on the right 
       that explain each design choice in more detail. The fonts I’ve used are simple and readable, making sure the text is easy on the eyes 
       while still being informative.

    <h3>THEORY PAGE</h3>
    <p>The theory page keeps the same style with a big, bold heading at the top, making it easy to identify what the page is about. The 
       navigation bar is clear and simple, right at the top for easy access to other sections of the site. This page will have my Assignment 
       2 essay available for download, along with any other essays or articles I’ve written about Interactive Media. I also plan to include 
       some extra resources like readings, podcasts, videos, and relevant links—basically anything I think is helpful or interesting for anyone 
       exploring this topic.

    <h3>VISUALISATION PAGE</h3>
    <p>The visualisation page keeps a consistent design with a large, clear heading at the top, making the purpose of the page obvious 
       right away. The navigation bar is straightforward and placed at the top, so users can easily switch between sections. On this page, 
       users will be able to choose between two visualisations through button images. However, only one visualisation will appear in the 
       center of the page at a time. My plan is to allow users to either swipe or click an arrow icon to switch between the images. Each 
       image will serve as a heading or a 'preview' of what the visualisation is about, making it more intuitive and interactive.

    <h3>VISUALISATION 1: TOP 10</h3>
    <p>The visualisation 1 page starts with a large, bold heading to grab attention, and the navigation bar is kept clear and simple at 
       the top for easy access. This page showcases my first data visualisation, focusing on the top golf players of 2024. Initially, 
       users will see the top 10 players displayed, but there's also a drop-down list that allows them to view the top 20 or top 30 players.

    <h3>VISUALISATION 2: TOP 20</h3>
    <p>When users change the selection, the bars adjust smoothly, shrinking and shifting to reveal the updated rankings. I've also added a 
       tooltip feature, so when users hover over each bar, they’ll get more detailed information about that player, enhancing the interactive 
       experience.

    <h3>VISUALISATION 2</h3>
    <p>The Visualisation 2 page follows the same clean design as the previous pages, with a large, bold heading and a clear navigation bar 
       at the top for easy access. This page features my second data visualisation, which displays the 2024 tournaments, their purse sizes, 
       and the player winnings. Instead of a bar graph, I’ve used bubbles of different sizes and colours to represent the tournament winnings, 
       making the data visually engaging. The larger the bubble, the higher the winnings, while the colours help distinguish different 
       tournaments. To enhance interactivity, when the user hovers over any of the bubbles, a tooltip appears with more detailed information, 
       providing an intuitive way for users to explore the data.

    <h3>ABOUT ME PAGE</h3>
    <p>The About Me page features a bold heading and a clean navigation bar at the top, making it easy for users to access. On this page, 
       I’ve included a personal image of myself along with some key information about me, such as my goals in this degree, my strengths and 
       weaknesses, and how I’ve found the process of creating this website. By sharing this information, I aim to give users a better sense of 
       who I am and what drives my work. The layout is designed to be simple and clear, with easy-to-read fonts to make sure the text is engaging 
       and accessible. This page helps humanise the website and adds a personal touch, enhancing the overall user experience.
