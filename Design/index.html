    <h3>HOME PAGE</h3>
    <p>On the homepage, I kept the heading nice and big to grab the user's attention right away. As they scroll down, three image buttons—
       'My Designs', 'Theory', and 'Visualisations'—appear smoothly, which makes the experience feel fluid and gives users a clear choice of 
       where to go next. I wanted these buttons to act as natural entry points to the main sections of the site.
    </p><br>
    <p>To make the buttons more interactive, I added a hover effect where they enlarge when the mouse moves over them, then shrink back once 
       the mouse is removed. It’s a simple but effective way to show users that these buttons are clickable. At the bottom of the page, I’ve 
       placed the footer so that important info like contact details and navigation options are always accessible.

    <h3>DESIGN PAGE</h3>
    <p>For the design page, I went with a large heading to keep things consistent and attention-grabbing right from the start. The 
       navigation bar sits at the top of the screen, nice and clear, so users can easily move between different sections. This page is where 
       I lay out all my design choices—everything from wireframes to the style guide, color scheme, UI/UX decisions, and website inspirations.
    </p><br>
    <p>To keep the layout clean and easy to follow, I placed all the images on the left-hand side, with accompanying paragraphs on the right 
       that explain each design choice in more detail. The fonts I’ve used are simple and readable, making sure the text is easy on the eyes 
       while still being informative.

    <h3>THEORY PAGE</h3>
    <p>The theory page keeps the same style with a big, bold heading at the top, making it easy to identify what the page is about. The 
       navigation bar is clear and simple, right at the top for easy access to other sections of the site. This page will have my Assignment 
       2 essay available for download, along with any other essays or articles I’ve written about Interactive Media. I also plan to include 
       some extra resources like articles, podcasts, videos, and relevant links—basically anything I think is helpful or interesting for anyone 
       exploring this topic.

    <h3>VISUALISATION PAGE</h3>
    <p>The visualisation page keeps a consistent design with a large, clear heading at the top, making the purpose of the page obvious 
       right away. The navigation bar is straightforward and placed at the top, so users can easily switch between sections. On this page, 
       users will be able to choose between two visualisations through button images. However, only one visualisation will appear in the 
       center of the page at a time. My plan is to allow users to either swipe or click an arrow icon to switch between the images. Each 
       image will serve as a heading or a 'preview' of what the visualisation is about, making it more intuitive and interactive.

    <h3>VISUALISATION 1</h3>
    <p>The visualisation 1 page starts with a large, bold heading to grab attention, and the navigation bar is kept clear and simple at 
       the top for easy access. This page showcases my first data visualisation, focusing on the top golf players of 2024. Initially, 
       users will see the top 10 players displayed, but there's also a drop-down list that allows them to view the top 20 or top 30 players.

    <p>When users change the selection, the bars adjust smoothly, shrinking and shifting to reveal the updated rankings. I've also added a 
       tooltip feature, so when users hover over each bar, they’ll get more detailed information about that player, enhancing the interactive 
       experience.

    <h3>VISUALISATION 2</h3>
    <p>The Visualisation 2 page follows the same clean design as the previous pages, with a large, bold heading and a clear navigation bar 
       at the top for easy access. This page features my second data visualisation, which displays the 2024 tournaments, their purse sizes, 
       and the player winnings. Instead of a bar graph, I’ve used bubbles of different sizes and colours to represent the tournament winnings, 
       making the data visually engaging. The larger the bubble, the higher the winnings, while the colours help distinguish different 
       tournaments. To enhance interactivity, when the user hovers over any of the bubbles, a tooltip appears with more detailed information, 
       providing an intuitive way for users to explore the data.

    <h3>ABOUT ME PAGE</h3>
    <p>The About Me page features a bold heading and a clean navigation bar at the top, making it easy for users to access. On this page, 
       I’ve included a personal image of myself along with some key information about me, such as my goals in this degree, my strengths and 
       weaknesses, and how I’ve found the process of creating this website. By sharing this information, I aim to give users a better sense of 
       who I am and what drives my work. The layout is designed to be simple and clear, with easy-to-read fonts to make sure the text is engaging 
       and accessible. This page helps humanise the website and adds a personal touch, enhancing the overall user experience.

    <h3>COLOUR PALETTE</h3>
    <p>I put a lot of thought into the color palette, opting for a blend of neutral tones with strategic pops of color. The neutral shades 
       create a calming, inviting atmosphere, which was important for the overall aesthetic, while the brighter accents help guide users’ 
       attention to key interactive elements like buttons and links. I wanted the palette to be visually appealing but also functional, ensuring 
       that users are naturally drawn to important parts of the site without feeling overwhelmed by too many loud colors.

    <h3>FONTS</h3>
    <p>For the website, I chose a combination of modern, easy-to-read fonts that would enhance both readability and accessibility. I wanted 
       the headings to stand out, so I selected a bold, stylish typeface that grabs attention, while keeping the body text more straightforward 
       and legible for longer reading sessions. It was important to me that the fonts complement each other, creating a sense of professionalism 
       and unity across the site. I also made sure the fonts would display well on all devices, maintaining consistency regardless of screen size.

    <h3>ST. ANDREWS LINKS</h3>
    <p class="website-link"><a href="https://www.standrews.com/homepage">St. Andrews Links Website</a>
    </p>
    <p>The St Andrews Links website is a comprehensive guide to everything related to the historic golf courses in St Andrews, Scotland. It 
       features detailed information about each course, booking options, and available services, such as equipment hire and caddy services. 
       The site also highlights the history and significance of St Andrews as the "Home of Golf." What stood out to me was how the website 
       beautifully balances functionality and user experience, with clear navigation and sections dedicated to golf events, sustainability 
       efforts, and even a shop for official merchandise. The layout makes it easy to find exactly what you need, whether it’s information on 
       a specific course or help with planning your visit.

    <p>When designing my own website, I drew inspiration from the St Andrews Links site, particularly in its use of clear navigation and 
       structured content. I wanted my website to reflect a similar ease of access, where visitors can quickly find the information they’re 
       looking for without being overwhelmed. The way St Andrews Links incorporates multimedia elements—like images and videos—while maintaining 
       a professional yet welcoming tone, also influenced how I designed visual elements for my site. The overall user experience was a benchmark 
       for creating a smooth, engaging journey for my own website's visitors.

    <h3>RALPH LAUREN</h3>
    <p class="website-link"><a href="https://www.ralphlauren.com/">Ralph Lauren Website</a>
    </p>
    <p>The Ralph Lauren website is a perfect example of elegance and high-end fashion combined with a user-friendly shopping experience. 
      The sleek design, clean layouts, and use of luxurious imagery instantly communicate the brand's identity. I noticed how they use neutral 
      colors like white, beige, and black to maintain a sophisticated look, while the large, high-quality photos of their products emphasize 
      detail and craftsmanship. The navigation is intuitive, making it easy to browse between categories like men's, women's, and children's 
      apparel, as well as their home decor section. Their storytelling element, "RL Stories," adds another layer by offering visitors a more 
      immersive experience into the lifestyle associated with the brand.

  <div class="text-container">
    <p>Using Ralph Lauren’s website as inspiration, I aimed to apply similar design choices to my own project. I wanted to create a clean 
       and polished look by adopting their use of simple, neutral backgrounds and well-placed images to give my website an elegant and 
       organized feel. I also took note of how they highlight products with high-resolution visuals and made sure to focus on quality 
       images that are central to my site. Additionally, I liked how they subtly integrated storytelling to build a stronger connection 
       with visitors, and I drew from this idea to enhance the narrative element of my site. The balance of luxury and functionality they 
       achieve served as a great model for my design choices.

    <h3>DESIGN CHOICES</h3>
    <p>When it came to the overall design, I prioritized simplicity and a user-centered approach. I aimed for a layout that was clean and 
       organized, allowing content to be easily digestible without overwhelming users. I utilized whitespace and consistent alignment to make 
       the pages feel balanced, while the strategic use of color and typography helped guide users through the site. Every design decision was 
       made with the user in mind, ensuring that the website was visually appealing, but most importantly, functional and easy to use.
    </p><br>
    <p>For the navbar, my goal was to make navigation as seamless and intuitive as possible. I kept the design clean and simple, avoiding 
       any unnecessary clutter. I also prioritized responsiveness, so the navbar adjusts nicely on different devices, from desktops to mobile 
       phones. I felt that a well-organized, minimalistic navbar would help users stay focused on the content rather than get distracted by the 
       navigation itself.
    </p><br>
    <p>Images play an essential role on the website, so I chose them carefully to support and complement the content. I made sure each image 
       has a purpose, avoiding the temptation to overload the site with visuals. Optimizing the images for quick load times without sacrificing 
       quality was also a priority, as I didn’t want users to experience slow performance. I paid particular attention to providing alt-text for 
       each image, ensuring the site is accessible for everyone, including those using screen readers. It was crucial for me to strike a balance 
       between aesthetics and functionality with the images.

    <h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>
    <p>Accessibility is something I focused on from the beginning. I wanted the site to be usable for everyone, so I incorporated features 
       like alt-text for images, sufficient color contrast, and a layout that is both clean and easy to navigate. I made sure the fonts were 
       scalable and responsive so users could adjust the text size to suit their needs. I also tested the site to ensure it could be navigated 
       entirely via keyboard, catering to users with mobility impairments. My aim was to create an inclusive design that doesn’t compromise on 
       appearance or usability.

    <h3>CONTRAST CHECKER</h3>
    <p>One of the tools I relied on during the design process was a contrast checker. It was important to me that the site met web accessibility 
       standards, so I used the checker to ensure there was enough contrast between text and background colors. This way, users with visual 
       impairments or those browsing in different lighting conditions would have no trouble reading the content. I feel this step added another 
       layer of inclusivity to the design, ensuring that the website is as user-friendly as possible.
