  <h2>PUB GOLF</h2>
  <p>Golf doesn't always have to be on a golf course...</p>

  <p>Pub Golf is the ultimate blend of boozy fun and competitive spirit. Picture this: you're at your local pub (or any watering hole with 
    alcohol, really), and you're ready to embark on a game where your sipping skills are tested to the max. Each round gets trickier, with 
    the number of sips required for each drink climbing higher, and the pressure mounting with every gulp. The rules? Well, they're as quirky 
    as the game itself:
  </p> 
  <p>> Spill your drink? That's a +2 penalty, my friend. <br>> First to hit the loo? Enjoy a shot, courtesy of your bladder.<br>> 
    Don’t even think about taking the easy route—NO Gimmies here! <br>> Fall over during play? Get ready for a +5. <br>> Then, there’s the Buddy Rule, 
    where you must “invigilate” your teammate’s performance, ensuring they don’t sneak in any unapproved moves. It's cart path only—no 
    shortcuts! <br>> Don’t forget the Pub Selfie to capture your blurry triumphs. <br>> A Mulligan is your one-time chance to redo a round 
    (because let’s face it, we all need it). 
  </p>
  <p>In the end, you tally up the sips, see who "shot" the best score, and determine who can truly 
    handle their drinks under pressure. Cheers to the wobbly road ahead!
