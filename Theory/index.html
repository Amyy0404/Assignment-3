    <div id="essay-container" class="essay-container" style="display: none;">
      <p>In today's data-driven world, data journalism has become essential for uncovering complex issues and presenting them in a manner that the public can understand. As emphasised by Cairo (2012), the influence of visual storytelling lies in its ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights. He mentions that by creating visuals that invite exploration, data journalists can enhance the public's understanding and foster a deeper engagement with the information presented. Looking at the data journalism project Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013), I will analyse the effectiveness of the visualisation techniques used, the importance of interactivity, the application of UI/UX design principles, and the integration of narrative elements to effectively communicate its message.
      </p>
      <p>Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) effectively uses different data visualisation techniques to communicate complex information about drone usage and its impact, particularly on the victims involved, without relying heavily on text. According to Sinar (2020), data visualisation involves employing various methods to display information in a way that is both comprehensible and visually appealing, enhancing user engagement and capturing the audience's attention. The project uses a combination of interactive elements, stacked bar charts, timelines, animations and various colour choices. These techniques are employed because Pitch Interactive (2007) aimed to present the information in a way that allows users to form their own opinions on the use of drones.
      </p>
      <p>This approach aligns with Cairo's (2012) discussion on how effective data visualisation must consider the audience's familiarity with the visual forms that are being used. Using recognisable visual elements like Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) makes the data more accessible, ensuring that users can easily comprehend the information presented. The stacked bar chart is used to display the individual number of people killed during a drone attack, with each smaller block representing a death, and the labels that appear when users hover over the bars provide additional context, such as the date of the attack, the number of attacks, the number of casualties, and their classifications.
      </p>
      <p>Nguyen et al. (2014) highlight how visualising the timeline, which ranges from 2004 to 2015, is another crucial element that enhances the project's effectiveness. According to Nguyen et al. (2014), allowing users to identify patterns and relationships in the visualisation helps them comprehend the data presented better. In Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) this would help improve the understanding of the sequences, frequency and distribution of drone attacks over the years to the users.
      </p>
      <p>Moreover, Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) successfully manages the complexity of multiple visualisations, enabling users to navigate between different views, such as the horizontal timeline and the 'Victims' tab, which sums up the number of victims by month on a vertical timeline. Heer and Schneiderman (2012) mention that this design technique simplifies the organisation of visual elements, making it easier for users to explore different aspects of the data without feeling overwhelmed.
      </p>
      <p>Colour plays a significant role in the project's overall design. Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) uses a dark colour palette, with prominent use of white, red, and black, to convey the seriousness of the subject matter. The careful selection of colours helps the viewers to process the given information without distraction, adhering to Sinar's (2020) statement that colour choices should support, rather than diminish, the message being conveyed by the visualisation.
      </p>
      <p>Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) shows the critical role of interactivity in big data visualisation, as outlined by the Yi et al. (2007) taxonomy of Interaction Techniques. The project utilises several of these techniques to enhance user engagement and understanding. One of the main techniques used is Selection, where users can hover over specific data points representing individual drone strikes. Yi et al. (2007) explain that this type of interaction allows for a deeper investigation into each of the strikes, with more details provided on demand. This selection process facilitates the users' ability to track cases and return to them as they explore the project further.
      </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the visualisation utilises Visual Encoding effectively, as explained by Yi et al. (2007), Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) successfully achieves this by representing different types of targets and casualties through varying colours, which improves the interpretability of the data. The final Interaction Technique from Yi et al.’s (2007) taxonomy is Connecting, which is utilised by linking related data points across the timeline of the drone strikes. This allows users to see patterns and relationships between different strikes and victims over time, creating a deeper understanding of the effect and frequency of these events.
      </p>
      <p>Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) highlights key elements of good UI/UX design. Cairo (2012) discusses a structured process that begins with a clear focus on the topic, followed by thorough research and which finally ends in a visually appealing visualisation. Looking at Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013), this approach is clear in its design, it effectively integrates UI/UX principles to enhance user interaction and engagement in the project.
      </p>
      <p>Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) begins with a clear focus on its narrative: the impact of drone strikes. This focus is reflected in the design’s organisation, where users can interact with the information underneath the timeline to explore detailed data about each drone attack. By enabling users to hover for more details, the project follows Cairo’s (2013) principle of ensuring that the infographic is useful and provides meaningful insights to the audience. This interactive feature not only aligns with the project's goals but also enhances the user experience by making complex data more accessible and engaging for users.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, Cairo’s (2013) approach highlights the importance of structuring information in a visually appealing way. Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) achieves this through its thoughtful use of interactive elements. The timeline and the 'Victims' tab are designed to offer different perspectives on the data, allowing users to navigate and understand the information in a way that suits their needs. This reflects Cairo’s (2013) emphasis on presenting findings in a structured manner that facilitates user interaction and comprehension.
      </p>
      <p>Segel and Heer (2010) state that storytelling in data visualisation aims to engage users, present complex information in an accessible way, and evoke emotional responses or provoke thought. According to Segel and Heer (2010), while data visualisation is often associated with storytelling, the precise relationship between the two is not always clear. They argue that understanding how different genres of visualisation interact with audiences is crucial to improving the way stories are told through data. In the Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013) project, storytelling principles are effectively utilised to convey the seriousness of drone attacks and their impact on the victims. This aligns with Segel and Heer's (2010) notion that narrative visualisation should create a connection with the audience by providing meaningful context.
      </p>
      <p>The project's use of colour and minimalist design contributes to a sombre and reflective tone, enhancing the emotional weight of the data being presented. Knaflic (2015) stresses the importance of pairing strong visuals with a compelling narrative to create an impactful data visualisation. In Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013), the visual simplicity, combined with interactive storytelling elements such as the animations landing on the timeline to represent the drone strikes, creates a powerful narrative experience that encourages users to think critically about the impact of drones used for violence. Knaflic (2015) discusses how the combination of narrative and visualisation ensures that the data is not only seen but felt, making the project a good example of how data visualisation can be used to tell an emotionally compelling story.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, the data visualisation project Out of Sight, Out of Mind (2013), found on the National Geographic website demonstrates the impact of data journalism, UI/UX design, and visual storytelling. Through a combination of interactive elements, minimalist design, and carefully selected visual techniques, the project effectively conveys the results of drone strikes. By aligning with the principles discussed by Cairo (2012) and others, the project transforms complex data, from The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, into a compelling narrative that resonates with its audience. This highlights how the interactive features and careful design not only engage users with the data presented but also deepen their understanding of it, illustrating the crucial role of visual storytelling in data-driven journalism and its effectiveness in communicating serious issues.

       <div id="essay-container" class="essay-container" style="display: none;">
         <p>This critical reflection essay focuses on my golf-themed website for my exam submission, which I designed to engage users by offering interactive data visualizations and a seamless, user-friendly experience. The website’s main functionalities include three distinct data visualizations and adherence to UI/UX design principles to ensure accessibility and intuitive navigation. The target audience for this site is golf enthusiasts, with the aim of providing them with meaningful insights into the sport while offering an engaging, immersive experience. The project incorporates key design elements such as style guides, wireframes, and a consistent layout to ensure visual cohesion across the site.
         </p>
         <p>This essay will discuss the integration of effective UI/UX design principles, the role of interactivity in user experience, and how these elements support data visualization and user engagement. I will refer to "Improving Website Design" by Ivory and Hearst (2002) to frame my discussion of efficient web design practices and explore how web technologies allow designers to craft immersive, visually engaging, and adaptable experiences across various devices. Additionally, I will address the challenges faced during the development process and how the website aligns with professional practices in international web and app development, ensuring that it meets both user needs and industry standards.
         </p>
         <p>I aimed to incorporate several web design principles as outlined by Ivory and Hearst (2002), ensuring the website is both functional and engaging for users. Their research outlines crucial principles such as navigation design, consistent layout, and the use of text and graphics, all of which I applied throughout the project to create an immersive, user-friendly, and visually appealing website. Web technologies today offer designers unprecedented freedom to craft dynamic, interactive, and visually engaging user experiences that adapt to a range of devices, creating a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile platforms.
         </p>
         <p>One of the most essential elements in creating a user-friendly experience is the navigation design, which facilitates user interaction with the information structure of the website. Following Ivory and Hearst’s (2002) recommendations, I ensured that the navigation mechanisms on the website were clear and intuitive. I implemented a top-level sticky navigation bar, which remained consistent across all pages, containing easy-to-find links to essential areas like the home page, the data visualizations, and the survey form. This approach, consistent with Ivory and Hearst’s (2002) suggestions, helps reduce cognitive load for the user, ensuring that they can efficiently access the content they are looking for without confusion or frustration.
        </p>
        <p>A key aspect of the website's design was ensuring a consistent layout across all pages to enhance user familiarity and ease of use, a principle emphasised by Ivory and Hearst (2002). This consistency allows users to intuitively navigate through the website without needing to reorient themselves as they move between pages. I maintained a uniform header, footer, and navigation bar on every page, as well as consistent margins, padding, and typography. Consistency across the website not only made the experience more enjoyable but also enhanced its accessibility, allowing users to easily interact with the content regardless of the device they used.
        </p>
        <p>The quality and formatting of text elements play a significant role in improving the overall readability and usability of a website. Following Ivory and Hearst’s (2002) guidance, I focused on using clear and concise language throughout the site, ensuring that the text was legible and easily understood by the target audience. The homepage and content pages feature well-structured text, with headings and subheadings that break up long sections of content. I adhered to the principle of using appropriate font styles and sizes for readability, selecting a custom font family for body text as well as a custom font for headings. To prevent visual clutter, I limited the number of text colours to just a few to enhance legibility.
        </p>
        <p>Ivory and Hearst (2002) also stress the importance of clear and informative link elements in a website's design. I carefully curated the links included on the website, ensuring they were both relevant to the content and easy to identify. Descriptive link text was used to inform users about the content they would access upon clicking, enhancing both accessibility and usability. For instance, instead of vague terms like "Click Here," I used specific phrases like "View Tournament Data" or "Look at my Designs," which made it immediately clear what the user would find by clicking on a link. Additionally, I ensured that links were visually distinct by using a consistent colour scheme and underlining each link to enhance its visibility. This helps users quickly navigate the site while avoiding frustration or confusion.
        </p>
        <p>Incorporating graphic elements like images is crucial to maintaining visual interest and enhancing the content. However, it is important to use images judiciously to avoid cluttering the page or slowing down page performance. Following the recommendations from Ivory and Hearst (2002), I carefully selected images that were relevant to the website’s content and added value to the user experience. I avoided overwhelming the user with excessive images by using them sparingly, ensuring that each image added meaning and context rather than just decoration. The images were also optimised for web performance to ensure the website loaded quickly, even on slower connections.
        </p>
        <p>Web performance is essential for maintaining user engagement, and Ivory and Hearst (2002) emphasise optimising page download speed and accessibility. I tested the website on multiple devices and browsers to ensure that pages loaded quickly and that the website was accessible to users with disabilities. 
        </p>
        <p>A well-structured site architecture is critical for ensuring that users can easily navigate and find information. Ivory and Hearst (2002) suggest that web designers create a logical site structure with consistent page elements. I organised the content into clear sections, each with a dedicated page for data visualizations, surveys, and other relevant information. This logical structure not only made the site easier to navigate but also ensured that information was easy to find. For example, the data visualizations were grouped into separate sections, allowing users to easily compare the different charts and analyse the data.
        </p>
        <p>Ivory and Hearst (2002) emphasise the importance of balancing the amount of text on a page to avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once. I adhered to this guideline by ensuring that the text on each page was concise and focused on key information. For example, on the homepage, I used brief, engaging text that provided a quick overview of the website’s features, while more detailed content was placed on subsequent pages. This approach allowed users to quickly grasp the purpose of the website without feeling bombarded by excessive text. Additionally, each data visualization included brief descriptions and annotations that provided context without overwhelming the user with unnecessary details. By keeping the text manageable, users were able to engage with the content without feeling fatigued.
        </p>
        <p>Ivory and Hearst (2002) suggest using clear and readable fonts, ensuring that the text quality is high and free from errors. I carefully selected a custom font for the body text, which helps with clarity and legibility, especially for web use. The font size was also chosen to maximize readability. Additionally, I ensured the quality of the text by proofreading all content, ensuring it was free from grammatical errors and properly structured. This attention to detail helped maintain a professional appearance and ensured that users could engage with the content without distractions from poor text quality.
        </p>
        <p>Simplicity in language and structure is another principle highlighted by Ivory and Hearst (2002), and I made it a priority in the website's design. I avoided overly technical jargon and ensured that the language used was clear and straightforward. For example, when explaining the data visualizations, I used simple language to make the content accessible to a broad audience, including those who may not have a background in data analysis or golf. This approach made the website more inclusive, ensuring that users of all levels could engage with the content comfortably.
        </p>
        <p>Ivory and Hearst (2002) recommend using formatting techniques, such as bold or italics, to emphasize important information but with restraint to avoid visual clutter. I implemented this by using bold text to highlight key headings and subheadings, as well as to draw attention to important terms or statistics. I also used italics sparingly to emphasize specific words or phrases that required extra attention. By applying these formatting techniques selectively, I was able to guide the user’s attention to the most important elements without overwhelming them with too much emphasis, ensuring that the design remained clean and easy to navigate.
        </p>
        <p>Ivory and Hearst (2002) stress the importance of maintaining sufficient contrast between text and background colours to enhance readability. I ensured that the text stood out clearly against the background by using light text on a dark background for most pages. This contrast provided high visibility and made reading comfortable for users in various lighting conditions. Additionally, I chose a colour scheme that complemented the overall design, ensuring a consistent and professional appearance while prioritizing readability.
        </p>
        <p>The quality of colour combinations for both text and graphical elements is critical to visual appeal and usability. Ivory and Hearst (2002) recommend a careful selection of colours to ensure they complement one another and enhance the user experience. I followed this principle by selecting a cohesive colour palette that included shades of blue, green, and beige, reflecting the golf theme. The contrast between text and background colours was optimized to make reading easier, and the colour choices for buttons and interactive elements were designed to make them stand out without clashing with the overall aesthetic.
        </p>
        <p>Maintaining a consistent colour scheme throughout the website helps create a cohesive and professional appearance, as noted by Ivory and Hearst (2002). I ensured that the colour scheme was consistent across all pages, with key elements like navigation bars, buttons, and headings featuring the same colours. This consistency not only helped create a more visually appealing site but also made navigation more intuitive, as users could easily identify interactive elements and understand the layout of the pages.
        </p>
        <p>I encountered several challenges, particularly in areas such as technical issues with JavaScript, responsive design, and efficient data loading. These obstacles required creative problem-solving and a thorough understanding of web development principles, which I addressed through research, the application of new frameworks, and collaborative feedback. Below, I outline the major challenges and the solutions I implemented to overcome them. One of the most significant challenges I faced was implementing form validation using JavaScript, which is a key feature for user interaction on the site. I needed to ensure that users could submit their information without errors, and this required validating inputs in the forms such as email addresses, golf handicaps, and survey responses. Initially, I encountered difficulties with ensuring that the JavaScript was functioning correctly, particularly with error handling and providing real-time feedback for invalid entries.          
        </p>
        <p>To tackle this challenge, I referred to resources like MDN Web Docs, which offered detailed guides on form validation. I also studied examples from other websites to understand how they handled real-time validation and error messages. After implementing a basic validation script, I ran into issues with inconsistent error messages, especially when users input incorrect data multiple times. By using JavaScript events like onblur and oninput, I created dynamic error notifications that appeared immediately when a user made an input mistake. This helped provide a more intuitive and responsive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>Another challenge I faced was ensuring that the website was fully responsive and displayed correctly across a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Responsive design is crucial for providing an optimal user experience, and the website had to adjust dynamically to different screen sizes. Initially, I struggled with achieving consistency in how the layout was adapted to smaller screens. Elements like images, text, and navigation bars would sometimes overlap or appear misaligned on mobile devices. Unfortunately, I did not get to address this issue. 
        </p>
        <p>The website required real-time data visualizations, and one of the primary challenges was ensuring that the data loaded efficiently, especially for the interactive charts and graphs. Given the large volume of data being processed, slow loading times became a problem, particularly when users were accessing the site from mobile networks with lower bandwidth. Because of time, the best I could do was implement a loading screen for the user, which keeps the overall design neat and immerses the users in the golf theme without showing the visuals of a loading data visualisation.
        </p>
        <p>Throughout the development process, I sought feedback from peers and potential users to ensure the website’s usability and design met the intended goals. One major challenge I faced was identifying pain points in the user experience that I had overlooked during development. For example, users found the navigation bar difficult to use initially, as it was not immediately obvious how to access certain sections of the site.
        </p>
        <p>I used feedback from user testing sessions to make improvements. In particular, I redesigned the navigation system, making it more intuitive by adding a sticky header with clear call-to-action buttons. I also made sure that the navigation bar remained easily accessible at the top of the page as users scrolled. Regular feedback from users helped identify areas for improvement, and through iterative changes, I was able to enhance the website’s functionality. 
        </p>
        <p>In conclusion, this website allowed me to apply key web design principles to create an engaging, user-friendly golf-themed website. By focusing on UI/UX best practices, including intuitive navigation, consistent layout, and clear, concise content, I was able to craft an immersive experience that effectively communicates the sport of golf through data visualizations. Despite facing several challenges—such as technical difficulties with JavaScript, responsive design issues, and efficient data loading—these obstacles provided valuable learning opportunities. Through research, applying new frameworks, and utilizing feedback from peers and users, I was able to overcome these challenges and refine the website's functionality. The process highlighted the importance of continuous improvement and iterative design, especially when addressing user experience issues and fine-tuning technical elements.

 <h2>REFLECTION </h2>
 <p class="par-description">
  Reflecting on my journey with D3 and the development of my data visualizations and website, I began with a clear thematic focus: golf. This choice 
  stemmed from my passion for the sport and the desire to create a visually appealing and engaging web experience that resonates with 
  fellow golf enthusiasts. With a theme in mind, I then turned my attention to the technical aspects, particularly exploring various APIs 
  to source relevant data. After some experimentation, I ultimately decided on RapidAPI, which provided a robust platform for accessing 
  dynamic golf-related data.
</p>
<p class="par-description">
  Once I secured my data source, I contemplated the best ways to present the information. I determined that a bar graph and a bubble graph 
  would effectively communicate the rankings of top golf players in 2024 and the purse sizes of various tournaments. This decision was not 
  merely about aesthetics; it was essential to ensure that the data was easily digestible and visually engaging.
</p>
<p class="par-description">
  In crafting the overall aesthetic, I made a concerted effort to maintain a clean, sophisticated look that aligns with the golf theme. 
  Drawing inspiration from notable websites like St. Andrews Links and Ralph Lauren, I aimed for a blend of elegance and functionality. 
  I selected a color palette that featured neutral tones with vibrant accents to guide user attention to key interactive elements. This 
  thoughtful design choice was critical to fostering a welcoming and professional atmosphere.
</p>
<p class="par-description">
  Accessibility was also a priority in my design process. I utilized a color contrast checker to ensure readability, selected clear and 
  legible fonts, and implemented user-friendly navigation features, including a side scroll bar, a top navigation bar, intuitive button 
  UI, and "bookmarks." While I focused on creating an engaging user interface, I recognize that my website's responsiveness still needs 
  improvement. I plan to address this as I prepare for my upcoming exam.
</p>
<p class="par-description">
  Throughout the development phase, I actively sought feedback from friends who tested my website. Their insights were invaluable, prompting 
  me to make several adjustments, such as refining font choices, enhancing background designs, adding hover effects to links, adjusting graph 
  colors, and modifying navigation buttons and images. This collaborative approach significantly enriched the user experience.
</p>
<p class="par-description">
  Instead of a conventional "About Me" page, I opted for a "Media" page, aiming to share more golf-related content, including articles 
  and podcasts. This decision was driven by my goal to create a commercial vibe for the website while providing valuable resources to visitors 
  interested in golf.
