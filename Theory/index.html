    <p class="essay-description">
       In our increasingly data-driven world, the challenge lies not just in collecting information but in presenting it in a way that is 
       meaningful and accessible to the public. In this essay, I explore the vital role of data journalism, focusing on the project Out of 
       Sight, Out of Mind (2013). I aim to analyze how this project effectively transforms complex statistics on drone usage into insightful 
       visuals that engage and inform the audience. By examining the techniques employed—such as interactivity, the thoughtful use of color, 
       and the integration of UI/UX design principles—I will highlight how visual storytelling can illuminate serious issues while fostering 
       a deeper understanding of the underlying data. This exploration serves to underscore the importance of presenting data in a way that 
       resonates with viewers, ultimately bridging the gap between raw numbers and impactful narratives.

 <h2 style="color: #4ea874; font-weight: lighter;">REFLECTION</h2>
 <p class="par-description">
  Reflecting on my journey with D3 and the development of my data visualizations and website, I began with a clear thematic focus: golf. This choice 
  stemmed from my passion for the sport and the desire to create a visually appealing and engaging web experience that resonates with 
  fellow golf enthusiasts. With a theme in mind, I then turned my attention to the technical aspects, particularly exploring various APIs 
  to source relevant data. After some experimentation, I ultimately decided on RapidAPI, which provided a robust platform for accessing 
  dynamic golf-related data.
<br>
<br>
  Once I secured my data source, I contemplated the best ways to present the information. I determined that a bar graph and a bubble graph 
  would effectively communicate the rankings of top golf players in 2024 and the purse sizes of various tournaments. This decision was not 
  merely about aesthetics; it was essential to ensure that the data was easily digestible and visually engaging.
<br>
<br>
  In crafting the overall aesthetic, I made a concerted effort to maintain a clean, sophisticated look that aligns with the golf theme. 
  Drawing inspiration from notable websites like St. Andrews Links and Ralph Lauren, I aimed for a blend of elegance and functionality. 
  I selected a color palette that featured neutral tones with vibrant accents to guide user attention to key interactive elements. This 
  thoughtful design choice was critical to fostering a welcoming and professional atmosphere.
<br>
<br>
  Accessibility was also a priority in my design process. I utilized a color contrast checker to ensure readability, selected clear and 
  legible fonts, and implemented user-friendly navigation features, including a side scroll bar, a top navigation bar, intuitive button 
  UI, and "bookmarks." While I focused on creating an engaging user interface, I recognize that my website's responsiveness still needs 
  improvement. I plan to address this as I prepare for my upcoming exam.
<br>
<br>
  Throughout the development phase, I actively sought feedback from friends who tested my website. Their insights were invaluable, prompting 
  me to make several adjustments, such as refining font choices, enhancing background designs, adding hover effects to links, adjusting graph 
  colors, and modifying navigation buttons and images. This collaborative approach significantly enriched the user experience.
<br>
<br>
  Instead of a conventional "About Me" page, I opted for a "Media" page, aiming to share more golf-related content, including articles 
  and podcasts. This decision was driven by my goal to create a commercial vibe for the website while providing valuable resources to visitors 
  interested in golf.
